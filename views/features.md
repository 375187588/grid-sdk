## Pure Lua

<p class="mb-5">
  Grid is a pure Lua game engine. We don't use vendor-specific scripting, such
  as a "GRDScript" to lock you in. If you decide to write portable Lua game
  code, all the more power to you.
</p>

## Powered by LÖVE

<p class="mb-5">
  Grid is built on [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). If you're familiar with LÖVE,
  it'll be even easier to graduate to game engine features, and you can take
  your LÖVE ecosystem software with you.

## Binds

<p class="mb-5">
  Input bindings allow your players to customize their controls and prevent you
  from needing to hard-code game commands.
