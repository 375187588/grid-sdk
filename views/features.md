## General purpose

<p class="mb-5">
  Grid is a general purpose 2D multiplayer game engine with first-class support
  for tile-based games. It includes no integrated development environment to
  lock you into the Grid Engine, and allows you to use the tools you prefer
  instead.
</p>

## Pure Lua

<p class="mb-5">
  Grid is a pure Lua game engine. We don't use vendor-specific scripting, such
  as a "GRDScript". If you decide to write portable Lua game code, all the more
  power to you.
</p>

## Powered by LÖVE

<p class="mb-5">
  Grid is built on [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/). If you're familiar with LÖVE,
  it'll be even easier to graduate to game engine features, and you can take
  your LÖVE ecosystem software with you.
