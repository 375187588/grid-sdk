# Product Roadmap

## Features page
<span class="badge badge-warning">In-progress</span>

**planimeter.org/grid-sdk/features** is planned to show engine features and
comparisons to other major engines in its class.

## Documentation update
<span class="badge badge-danger">Blocked</span>

Grid engine documentation is currently generated by a Grid engine plugin called
[grid-docs](https://github.com/Planimeter/grid-docs). This is a partially
automated process. Full documentation automation attempts have been made with
doxygen with an experimental Lua language filter. LuaDoc, LDoc, and Lua parsers
lua-fish, Metalua, and lua-parser have been considered for documentation
automation.

## Voice chat
<span class="badge badge-warning">In-progress</span>

## Box-model gui update
<span class="badge badge-warning">In-progress</span>

Updates to `gui.box`, `gui.createElement`, and other box-model calls for the GUI
subsystem have been added. Stylesheets are being considered.
