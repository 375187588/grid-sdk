## Documentation update
<span class="badge badge-danger">Blocked</span>

Grid engine documentation is currently generated by a Grid engine plugin called
**[grid-docs](https://github.com/Planimeter/grid-docs)**. This is a partially
automated process. Full documentation automation attempts have been made with
doxygen with an experimental Lua language filter. LuaDoc, LDoc, and Lua parsers
lua-fish, Metalua, and lua-parser have been considered for documentation
automation.

## Voice chat

  in-progress. Opus support is planned.

Updates to `gui.box`, `gui.createElement`, and other box-model calls for the GUI
subsystem have been added. Stylesheets are being designed.
