# Product Roadmap

## Features page
*In-progress*

**planimeter.org/grid-sdk/features** is planned to show engine features and
comparisons to other major engines in its class.

## Documentation update
*Blocked*

Grid engine documentation is currently generated by a Grid engine plugin called
[grid-docs][1]. This is a partially automated process. Full documentation
automation attempts have been made with doxygen with an experimental Lua
language filter. LuaDoc, LDoc, and Lua parsers lua-fish, Metalua, and lua-parser
have been considered for documentation automation.

## Voice chat
*In-progress*

Voice chat bindings and engine calls have been added.

## Box-model gui update
*In-progress*

Updates to `gui.box`, `gui.createElement`, and other box-model calls for the GUI
subsystem has been added. Stylesheets are being considered.
